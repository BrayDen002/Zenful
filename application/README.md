# Application Folder

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to store all the source code and related files for your team's application. 
All the code for prototypes must be hosted within the prototypes' folder. DO NOT put code for prototypes. The code you
host outside the prototypes' folder belongs to your final version of your software product only. 

You are free to organize the contents of the prototypes' folder as you see fit. But remember your team is graded on how you use Git. 
This does include the structure of your application. Points will be deducted from poorly structured application folders.

## Please use the rest of the README.md to store important information for your team's application.
